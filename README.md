# aspnet-core-newrelic-docker
We will be using NewRelic with Docker to get Net Core 7.0 up and running. In this project, we will be looking at what the types of all the custom events in NewRelic are, how we can create a dashboard for them, how we can handle errors using NewRelic query types, and how we can set up alert systems.
